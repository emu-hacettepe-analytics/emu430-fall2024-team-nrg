The analysis is divided into three key sections:\n1. Highlighting EV Benefits: Presenting data to demonstrate the low carbon emissions associated with electric vehicles, emphasizing their environmental advantages.\n2. Global Trends: Presenting data on the adoption of EVs and transportation-related carbon emissions worldwide over the years, highlighting comparative trends.\n3. Türkiye’s Status and Recommendations: Analyzing the progress of EV adoption in Türkiye, interpreting its current standing, and proposing actionable strategies based on global benchmarks to enhance sustainability in the transportation sector. This comprehensive study aims to shed light on the environmental benefits of EVs and offer data-driven recommendations for Türkiye’s transportation sector.\n\n\nGeneral Information\n\nThe aim of our project is to examine the impact of electric vehicles (EVs) on CO2 emissions and analyze the integration of electric vehicles in Turkey. Electric vehicles stand out for their environmental benefits, particularly their potential to reduce CO2 emissions. On a global scale, while countries like China and the United States, which are major sources of emissions, have seen an increase in CO2 emissions, countries such as Norway and Denmark have successfully reduced emissions through the widespread adoption of non-carbon emitting vehicles.\nIn Turkey, although the number of electric vehicles has increased, there has yet to be a significant decrease in CO2 emissions. The primary reasons for this are infrastructure gaps and limited use of renewable energy sources. This highlights the need for improving the energy infrastructure and rapidly expanding the electric vehicle infrastructure in Turkey. In conclusion, while the adoption of electric vehicles has significant potential to reduce CO2 emissions, the success of this transition depends on factors such as population density and energy infrastructure.\nNorway and Denmark have achieved great success in adopting electric vehicles because these countries widely use renewable energy sources and have low population densities, making the environmental impact of EVs more pronounced.\nOn the other hand, China and the United States, with their high population densities and fossil fuel-based energy infrastructures, have been unable to prevent the increase in emissions.\nIn particular, China, with its large population and reliance on fossil fuel-based energy production, has increased its electric vehicle sales but has been limited in reducing total CO2 emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

This disparity has been one of the primary drivers behind the recent surge in renewable energy investments and efforts to move away from fossil fuels in both countries.\nHigh emission levels have placed immense pressure on the United States and China to address climate change, accelerating their transition to sustainable energy sources.\nThe renewable energy initiatives undertaken by these two nations have created a significant domino effect worldwide, propelling the global shift toward the sustainability era. These efforts are not only aimed at reducing their own high emission levels but also serve as an example for other countries to transition to cleaner energy systems. One of the most tangible examples of this influence is the rapidly growing electric vehicle (EV) sector, driven by the United States as a hub of technological innovation and China as the world’s largest manufacturer and market for EVs.\nThe big majority of mean transportation carbondioxide emissions consisted of top 20 countries.\nTurkey is 19th country with the largest mean transportation carbondioxide emission level.\n\nAfter this plot, the group has chosen specific countries to explore their behaviour over time. United States and China has chosen for being in first two place in the mean carbondioxide emission standings, Norway and Denmark for not being in top 20 countries list, and even they have been successful at decreasing their emission, Turkey and Japan to investigate the important parameters that carbondioxide emission is dependent.\n\n\nCode\ntop6_countries &lt;- c(\"United States\", \"Norway\", \"Denmark\", \"China\", \"Japan\", \"Turkey\")\n\nemission_by_country &lt;- my_data3 |&gt;\n  filter(entity %in% top6_countries)\n\nhead(emission_by_country)\n\n\n         entity code year transport_co2_emissions\n1         China  CHN 2011               621890000\n2       Denmark  DNK 2011                12640000\n3         Japan  JPN 2011               223030000\n4        Norway  NOR 2011                14980000\n5        Turkey  TUR 2011                44000000\n6 United States  USA 2011              1633590000\n\n\nHere, emission_by_country is the more tidied version of my_data3 in which the interested countries’ carbondioxide emission is analyzed.\nThe line plot below visualizes how much tons of carbondioxide did each selected country emit:\n\n\nCode\nggplot(emission_by_country, aes(x = year, y = transport_co2_emissions, color = entity)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    trans = \"log10\",\n    breaks = c(1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, 100000000, 1000000000, 10000000000),\n    labels = c(\"1\", \"10\", \"100\", \"1K\", \"10K\", \"100K\", \"1M\", \"10M\", \"100M\", \"1B\", \"10B\")\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2011:2021) +\n  facet_wrap(~ entity) +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", \n       y = \"CO2 Emission\",\n       title = \"Carbondioxide Emissions by Entity (Logarithmic Scale)\",\n       subtitle = \"From 2011 to 2021 (in tons)\"\n       ) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some observations from this graph:\n\nIt can be observed that there is a persistent increase in the carbondioxide emission levels in Turkey and China.

Japan and Norway has a considerable decreasing trend in its carbondioxide emission level.\nUSA has the highest carbondioxide emission compared to others, exceeding one billion tons of carbondioxide.\n\nThis graph compares those 6 countries very well, but it’s not possible to see the trends for each of them. Therefore, the line plot below has been made to display the trend in the transportation carbondioxide emission levels of those exactly same countries to make a comparison.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(emission_by_country, aes(x = year, y = transport_co2_emissions, color = entity)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    trans = \"log10\",\n    breaks = c(1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, 100000000, 1000000000, 10000000000),\n    labels = c(\"1\", \"10\", \"100\", \"1K\", \"10K\", \"100K\", \"1M\", \"10M\", \"100M\", \"1B\", \"10B\")\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2011:2021) +\n  facet_wrap(~ entity, scale = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", \n       y = \"CO2 Emission\",\n       title = \"Carbondioxide Emissions by Entity (Logarithmic Scale)\",\n       subtitle = \"Carbondioxide emission trends from 2011 to 2021\"\n       ) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some observations from this graph:\n\nIt can be observed that China’s, USA’s and Turkey’s total transportation carbondioxide emission level have an increasing trend over years while Denmark’s, Norway’s and Japan’s have a decreasing trend.\nAll of the countries have a clear reduction of total transportation carbondioxide emission level in 2020. This is the effect of COVID-19 pandemic which causes a V-shaped pattern for all countries listed.\n\nThis graphs gives a lot of information about transportation carbondioxide emission levels of those countries. But is it correct to make a decision just by looking at these graphs only? May population be the reason of some countries’ low/high total transportation carbondioxide emission levels? Let’s analyze it."

China has started using FCEV’s (in 2016) later than the others (in 2011-2014). It can be also observed that BEV sales has started 2012 in Turkey.\nChina has increased its BEV and FCEV sales more than any other country, however from the last analyses we know that it couldn’t make any big difference in total transportation carbondioxide emission since it’s population is too high. On the other hand, in Norway and Denmark, BEV’s and FCEV’s has a positive effect on total transportation carbondioxide emission since their populations are much lower than China.\nIt can be seen that Japan didn’t increase the sales of BEV’s. Yet, they managed to decrease the total transportation carbondioxide emission by increasing the FCEV sales considerably, which means they have done some other applications."
