# ANALYSIS OF CO2 EMISSION FROM TRANSPORT DATA (my_data3)

my_data3 will be used for this part of analysis. Therefore, here is the general information that's needed:

```{r}
#| echo: true
str(my_data3)
```

**entity:** A character column in my_data3 data set which represents the countries, continents, some income levels and the world.

**code:** A character column in my_data3 data set which represents the codes of the countries. (There are no codes for non-countries)

**year:** An integer column in my_data3 data set which represents the year.

**transport_co2_emissions:** A numeric column in my_data3 data set which represents the total carbon emission in tons.

## Country Based Mean Transportation CO2 Emission

Let's take a look at the top 20 countries' mean transportation carbondioxide emission from 2011 to 2021. To do this, the **entity** column of my_data3 has tidied to exclude the entities that are non-countries.

```{r}
#| echo: true
non_countries <- c(
  "World", 
  "Upper-middle-income countries", 
  "Lower-middle-income countries", 
  "Low-income countries", 
  "High-income countries", 
  "European Union (27)", 
  "Europe", 
  "Asia", 
  "Africa",
  "North America",
  "South America",
  "Oceania"
)

mean_co2_emission_by_country <- my_data3 |> 
  filter(!entity %in% non_countries) |>
  group_by(entity) |>
  summarize(mean_co2_emission_per_year = mean(transport_co2_emissions, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  mutate(entity_lumped = fct_lump_n(entity, n = 20, w = mean_co2_emission_per_year)) |>
  group_by(entity_lumped) |>
  summarize(mean_co2_emission_per_year = mean(mean_co2_emission_per_year, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

head(mean_co2_emission_by_country)
```

Note that to be able to see the mean carbondioxide emission of **the rest of the world**, it is combined into the observation **Other**.

It's needed to see the transportation carbondioxide emission levels of countries through the years to get more information about them. Below, the amounts of some of those 20 countries' (which are chosen specifically by team NRG) mean transportation carbondioxide emission (in tons) are displayed in the graph with the tidied version of my_data3.

```{r}
#| echo: true
ggplot(mean_co2_emission_by_country, aes(x = reorder(entity_lumped, mean_co2_emission_per_year), y = mean_co2_emission_per_year, fill = entity_lumped)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(scale = 1, accuracy = 1)) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Country",
       y = "Mean CO2 Emission",
       title = "Mean CO2 Emission by Country",
       subtitle = "From 2011 to 2021 (in tons)") +
  theme_light() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

**Conclusion:**

-   **The big majority** of mean transportation carbondioxide emissions consisted of top 20 countries.

-   **Turkey** is **19th country** with the largest mean transportation carbondioxide emission level.

After this plot, the group has chosen specific countries to explore their behaviour over time. **United States and China** has chosen for being in first two place in the mean carbondioxide emission standings, **Norway and Denmark** for not being in top 20 countries list, and even they have been successful at decreasing their emission, **Turkey and Japan** to investigate the important parameters that carbondioxide emission is dependent.

```{r}
top6_countries <- c("United States", "Norway", "Denmark", "China", "Japan", "Turkey")

emission_by_country <- my_data3 |>
  filter(entity %in% top6_countries)

head(emission_by_country)
```

Here, **emission_by_country** is the more tidied version of my_data3 in which the interested countries' carbondioxide emission is analyzed.

The line plot below visualizes how much tons of carbondioxide did each selected country emit:

```{r}
#| echo: true
ggplot(emission_by_country, aes(x = year, y = transport_co2_emissions, color = entity)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    trans = "log10",
    breaks = c(1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, 100000000, 1000000000, 10000000000),
    labels = c("1", "10", "100", "1K", "10K", "100K", "1M", "10M", "100M", "1B", "10B")
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2011:2021) +
  facet_wrap(~ entity) +
  labs(x = "Year", 
       y = "CO2 Emission",
       title = "Carbondioxide Emissions by Entity (Logarithmic Scale)",
       subtitle = "From 2011 to 2021 (in tons)"
       ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) # rotate x-axis labels
```

Here are some observations from this graph:

1.  It can be observed that there is a persistent increase in the carbondioxide emission levels in **Turkey and China**. China is very close to emit one billion tons of carbondioxide.

2.  **Denmark** has decreased its carbondioxide emission level after a 10-year horizon. **Japan and Norway** has a considerable decreasing trend in its carbondioxide emission level.

3.  **USA** has the highest carbondioxide emission compared to others, exceeding one billion tons of carbondioxide.

This graph compares those 6 countries very well, but it's not possible to see the trends for each of them. Therefore, the line plot below has been made to display the **trend** in the transportation carbondioxide emission levels of those exactly same countries to make a comparison.

```{r}
#| echo: true
ggplot(emission_by_country, aes(x = year, y = transport_co2_emissions, color = entity)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    trans = "log10",
    breaks = c(1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, 100000000, 1000000000, 10000000000),
    labels = c("1", "10", "100", "1K", "10K", "100K", "1M", "10M", "100M", "1B", "10B")
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2011:2021) +
  facet_wrap(~ entity, scale = "free_y") +
  labs(x = "Year", 
       y = "CO2 Emission",
       title = "Carbondioxide Emissions by Entity (Logarithmic Scale)",
       subtitle = "Carbondioxide emission trends from 2011 to 2021"
       ) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) # rotate x-axis labels
```

Here are some observations from this graph:

1.  It can be observed that China's, USA's and Turkey's total transportation carbondioxide emission level have an increasing trend over years while Denmark's, Norway's and Japan's have a decreasing trend.

2.  All of the countries have a clear reduction of total transportation carbondioxide emission level **in 2020**. This is the effect of **COVID-19 pandemic** which causes a **V-shaped pattern** for all countries listed.

This graphs gives a lot of information about transportation carbondioxide emission levels of those countries. But is it correct to make a decision just by looking at these graphs only? May population be the reason of some countries' low/high total transportation carbondioxide emission levels? Let's analyze it.

# ANALYSIS OF THE POPULATION DATA ALONG WITH CO2 EMISSIONS (my_data3 and my_data8)

## The Effect of Population on Transport CO2 Emissions

```{r}
str(my_data8)
```

EXPLANATION ?

```{r}
countries_selected <- c("United States", "Norway", "Denmark", "China", "Japan", "Turkey")

pop_n_co2 <- my_data3 |>
  full_join(my_data8, by = c("entity" = "entity", "year" = "year")) |>
  replace_na(list(transport_co2_emissions = 0, population = 0))
head(pop_n_co2)
```

Here, two data frames has been joined to include carbondioxide emissions and population columns in one data frame and replace the NA values to zero.

```{r}
pop_n_co2 <- pop_n_co2 |>
  mutate(prop = transport_co2_emissions / population) |>
  filter(entity %in% countries_selected)
head(pop_n_co2)
```

After that, the data has filtered by selected countries.

The line plot below visualizes the selected countries' carbondioxide emission per person on the average over time:

```{r}
ggplot(pop_n_co2, aes(x = year, y = prop, color = entity)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2011:2021) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "CO2 Emission (in tons) / Population",
       title = "CO2 Emission per Person",
       subtitle = "Describes how much carbondioxide emission does a person emits on the average
(in tons)",
       color = "Entity")
```

Here are some observations from this graph:

1.  When we analyze the transportation carbon emission per person, even China has the one of the highest total transportation carbondioxide emission, it can be seen that **China** has the lowest transportation carbondioxide emission per person among all other countries. While **USA** on the other hand, still has the highest level.

2.  **Denmark's, Norway's and Japan's** transportation carbon emission per person have a **decreasing** trend.

3.  **Turkey's** transportation carbon emission per person is **not high** but it has an **increasing** trend.

4.  The decrease **in 2020** can be seen again.

# GLOBAL EV SALES (my_data2)

```{r}
str(my_data2)
```

**region:** A character column in my_data2 data set which represents the countries and the world.

**category:** A character column in my_data2 data set which represents how the data has collected.

**parameter:** A character column in my_data2 data set which represents the parameter of the data collected.

**mode:** A character column in my_data2 data set which represents the vehicle types.

**powertrain:** A character column in my_data2 data set which represents how the vehicle gets its power from, a.k.a. type of the powertrain that the vehicle uses which are EV, BEV, PHEV etc.

**year:** A numeric column in my_data2 data set which represents the year.

**unit:** A character column in my_data2 data set which represents the unit that is used.

**value:** A numeric column in my_data2 data set which represents the amount of the vehicles in unit.

## Sales of No Carbon Vehicles

What about the countries' adoption on EV's? To be able to understand the relationship between EV sales and transportation, my_data2 is used. The same countries are filtered from it.

The types of EV's are summarized below.

-   Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)
-   Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)
-   Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV)
-   Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV)
-   Mild Hybrid Vehicle (MHEV)

**BEV and FCEV** sales are analysed since they're the no carbon ones.

```{r}
#| echo: true
my_data2$region[my_data2$region == "Turkiye"] <- "Turkey"
top6_countries = c("USA", "Norway", "Denmark", "China", "Japan", "Turkey")
no_carbon = c("BEV", "FCEV")

top6_ev_sales <- my_data2 |>
  filter(region %in% top6_countries, parameter == "EV sales", powertrain %in% no_carbon)

top6_ev_sales |> mutate(value = as.numeric(format(value, scientific = FALSE)))

head(top6_ev_sales)
```

The line plot below visualizes how the EV Sales of Non-Carbon Vehicles has evolved over the 10-year horizon:

```{r}
#| echo: true
top6_ev_sales |> group_by(year, region, powertrain) |>
  summarize(total_sales = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = total_sales, color = region, linetype = powertrain)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2011:2021) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log10",
                     labels = label_number(scale = 1, accuracy = 1)
                     ) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Sales",
       title = "Sales of No Carbon Vehicles (Logarithmic Scale)",
       subtitle = "The behaviour of the number of sales of vehicles that emit no carbon over time",
       color = "Region",
       linetype = "Powertrain Type"
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~ region) +
  theme_light() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + # rotate x-axis labels
  guides(color = "none") # remove the region legend
  
top6_ev_sales
```

Here are some observations from this graph:

1.  All countries in the plot increased their non-carbon emitting vehicle sales after 10-year horizon. However, **Turkey** has not been adopted **FCEV's through 2021** yet, while the other countries are using **FCEV's** more year by year. **China** has started using **FCEV's** (in 2016) **later** than the others (in 2011-2014). It can be also observed that **BEV** sales has started **2012 in Turkey**.

2.  **China** has increased its **BEV** and **FCEV** sales more than any other country, however from the last analyses we know that it couldn't make any big difference in total transportation carbondioxide emission since it's population is too high. On the other hand, **in Norway and Denmark**, **BEV's** and **FCEV's** has a **positive** effect on total transportation carbondioxide emission since their populations are much lower than **China**.

3.  It can be seen that **Japan** didn't increase the sales of **BEV's**. Yet, they managed to decrease the total transportation carbondioxide emission by increasing the **FCEV** sales considerably, which means they have done some other applications.

## Exploring the Relationship Between CO2 Emission and Total EV Sales (my_data2 and my_data3)

So, how carbondioxide emission has been affected by total EV sales?

For this part of analysis, **my_data2** and **my_data3** will be used. The selected countries will be analyzed again.

```{r}
countries_selected <- c("United States", "Norway", "Denmark", "China", "Japan", "Turkey")

my_data2$region[my_data2$region == "USA"] <- "United States"

my_data2_selected <- my_data2 |>
  filter(region %in% countries_selected, parameter == "EV sales") |>
  group_by(region, year) |>
  summarize(total_ev_sales = sum(value), .groups = "keep")

my_data3_selected <- my_data3 |>
  filter(entity %in% countries_selected) |>
  select(-code)

my_data2_3_selected <- my_data2_selected |>
  full_join(my_data3_selected, by = c("region" = "entity", "year" = "year")) |>
  replace_na(list(total_ev_sales = 0, transport_co2_emissions = 0))
head(my_data2_3_selected)
```

Join operation is used again. NA values stems from joining operation has been set to zero.

However, one of the selected countries has named differently, which is USA. To avoid this, **USA** in my_data2 has been changed to **United States**.

Now, the total EV sales and transport CO2 emissions can be seen in one tibble.

The scatter plot below visualizes the behaviour including trend lines connecting these points in each selected country.

```{r}
ggplot(my_data2_3_selected, aes(x = total_ev_sales, y = transport_co2_emissions, color = region)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, linetype = "dashed", size = 0.8, alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10",
                     labels = label_number(scale = 1, accuracy = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log10",
                     labels = label_number(scale = 1, accuracy = 1)) +
  labs(x = "Total EV Sales",
       y = "CO2 Emission (in tons)",
       title = "Scatter Plot of CO2 Emission vs. Total EV Sales",
       subtitle = "The correlation between total EV sales and carbondioxide emissions for
each selected region",
       color = "Region") +
  theme_light()
```

The correlation between total sales and carbondioxide emission is **not always** positive. **Half of the countries** has succeeded to decrease their carbondioxide emissions despite their increase in the **total EV sales**.

# TURKEY's STATUS (my_data4)

```{r}
#| echo: true
str(my_data4)
```

**year:** A character column in my_data4 data set which represents the year.

**total:** A character column in my_data4 data set which represents the total number of vehicles that are on traffic.

**percentage_total:** A character column which represents the total number of vehicles over total number of vehicles.

**gas:** A column in my_data4 data set which represents the vehicles which operates with gas.

**percentage_gas:** A character column which represents the number of vehicles that uses gas over total number of vehicles.

**diesel:** A column in my_data4 data set which represents the vehicles which operates with diesel.

**percentage_diesel:** A character column which represents the number of vehicles that are diesel over total number of vehicles.

**lpg:** A column in my_data4 data set which represents the vehicles which operates with LPG.

**percentage_lpg:** A character column which represents the number of vehicles that uses lpg over total number of vehicles.

**hybrid:** A column in my_data4 data set which represents the vehicles which operates with hybrid.

**percentage_hybrid:** A character column which represents the number of vehicles that are hybrid over total number of vehicles.

**electric:** A column in my_data4 data set which represents the vehicles which operates with electric.

**percentage_electric:** A character column which represents the number of vehicles that uses electric over total number of vehicles.

**unknown:** A column in my_data4 data set which represents the vehicles which operates with unknown power.

**percentage_unknown:** A character column which represents the number of vehicles that are unknown over total number of vehicles.

## Vehicle Trends in Turkey

How about the adoption of **EV's** and **the others** **in Turkey?**

**my_data4** will be used for this part of analysis.

```{r}
#| echo: true
tr_vehicle_num <- my_data4 |>
  mutate(across(everything(), as.numeric)) |>
  select(-starts_with("percentage"))

tr_vehicle_num_long <- tr_vehicle_num |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(gas, diesel, lpg, hybrid, electric, unknown), 
    names_to = "vehicle_type", 
    values_to = "value"        
  )

head(tr_vehicle_num_long)
```

Here, the percentage column is deleted, and all other columns of vehicle types and their values have been brought into columns named **vehicle_type** and **value** by using **pivot_longer()** function.

In order to visualize the vehicles trend in Turkey, the following code is used:

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(tr_vehicle_num_long, aes(x = year, y = value, color = vehicle_type)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Value",
       title = "Vehicle Trends in Turkey Over Time (Logarithmic Scale)",
       subtitle = "From 2011 to 2021"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2011:2021) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    trans = "log10",
    breaks = c(1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000),
    labels = c("1", "10", "100", "1K", "10K", "100K", "1M", "10M")
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)
  )
```

Although there was an **increase** in **EV's** and **hybrid** vehicles, **Turkey's** total transportation carbondioxide emission has increased **consistently** (information from Country Based Mean Transportation CO2 Emission section) and the effect of COVID-19 pandemic was quite **temporary** on it.

The behaviour of the number of vehicles is known now. However, an important question is, have these increases in the number of **EV** and **hybrid** vehicles been considerable on a proportional view?

```{r}
vehicle_prop <- c("percentage_gas", "percentage_diesel", "percentage_lpg", "percentage_hybrid", "percentage_electric", "percentage_unknown")

tr_vehicle_perc_long <- my_data4 |>
  pivot_longer(cols = vehicle_prop, names_to = "vehicle_type", values_to = "percentage") |>
  select(year, vehicle_type, starts_with("percentage"))

tr_vehicle_perc_long$percentage <- as.numeric(tr_vehicle_perc_long$percentage)

head(tr_vehicle_perc_long)
```

This time, columns including percentages and their values have been selected brought into columns named **vehicle_type** and **percentage**, respectively, by using **pivot_longer()** function.

The cumulative bar plot below displays the proportion of vehicle types over time.

```{r}
#| echo: true
ggplot(tr_vehicle_perc_long, aes(x = year, y = percentage, fill = vehicle_type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "fill", width = 0.8) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Percentage",
       title = "Vehicle Propensity in Turkey Over Time",
       subtitle = "From 2011 to 2021"
  ) +
  theme_tufte()
```

In fact, **non-EV's** were still used widely **in Turkey**, leading to be the one of the reason of increase in carbondioxide emission levels.
